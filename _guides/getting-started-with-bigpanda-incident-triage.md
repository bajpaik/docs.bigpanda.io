title: "Part 4: Incident Triage"
---

As we discussed in previous parts of this guide, BigPanda automatically groups alerts into incidents by host, cluster, or application. These incidents are then organized into Environments, where each team can easily triage and handle them.

With BigPanda, you have these useful tools available to help with the triage process: snoozing and sharing.

#### Snooze Non-Urgent Incidents

When a new incident arrives, first ask yourself if it's immediately actionable. A low diskspace issue, for example, can often wait for weeks before it becomes urgent. If you are not planning to do anything about a low priority issue right now, it can be helpful to get it out of the way. With BigPanda, you can easily snooze incidents for various periods of time.

Click the bell icon, and then select the snooze period.

By snoozing non-urgent incidents, you keep your feed clean and your team focused on the right issues at the right time. When the snooze period has elapsed, the incident again appears in the active feed.

To see all the snoozed incidents, click the **Snoozed** folder in the left pane. Click the bell icon to cancel the snooze immediately or change the snooze period.

#### Sharing Incidents with Your Co-workers

If you would like to inform a co-worker of an incident or collaborate on its solution, you can easily share it from BigPanda. Simply click the **Share** icon and follow the instructions to select the sharing method and the recipients.
