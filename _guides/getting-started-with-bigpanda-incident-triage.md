title: "Part 2: Incident Triage"
---

As we discussed [in part 1 of this series](getting-started-with-bigpanda-incident-feed.html), BigPanda automatically tackles the grouping of alerts into incidents by host, cluster, or application as they come in. Once that's done, the most important thing to do next is to decide on that incident's priority. This process is known as incident triage and it ensures that your team is channeling its efforts wisely. BigPanda gives you two easy-to-use ways to prioritize your work: snoozing and starring. 

#### Snooze Non-Urgent Incidents

When a new incident arrives, first ask yourself if it's immediately actionable. A low diskspace issue, for example, often waits for weeks before it becomes urgent. If you are not planning to do anything about a low priority issue right now, it can be helpful to get it out of the way. With BigPanda, you can easily snooze any incident for: _1 hour, 6 hours, 1 day, or 1 week_.

By snoozing non-urgent incidents, you will keep your feed clean and your team focused on the right issues at the right time. Once the allocated snooze-period has elapsed, the incident will arrive back in your feed right where it belongs.

To see all the snoozed incidents, simply select the **Snoozed** folder on the left pane. Here, you can easily unsnooze any items by clicking on the bell icon and choosing "Cancel Snooze".

#### Sharing Incidents With Your Co-workers

If you would like to inform a co-worker of the incident or collaborate on its solution, you can easily share it from BigPanda. Simply select the **Share** button and follow the instructions - you'll be able to select the media and the recipients.

Reduce the noise, collaborate better, and resolve issues faster with BigPanda. Now that you know your way around the incident feed and we've discussed snoozing, we will discuss incident analysis in [part three of our Getting Started with BigPanda guide](getting-started-with-bigpanda-incident-analysis.html).
