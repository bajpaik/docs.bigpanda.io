#### Automatically Share Incidents via Escalation Channels with AutoShare

Use AutoShare rules to share incident information with key team members when and how they need it to assist in the resolution process. Any incident in any BigPanda Environment can be shared automatically through any escalation channel, such as ServiceNow, JIRA, HipChat, Slack, or Asana. Configure one or more escalation channels in the **Integrations** tab, and then configure AutoShare rules in the **AutoShare** tab.

#### Creating a New Escalation Channel
Click the **Integrations** tab. Scroll down to the **Sharing & Ticket Management** section and select the system you want to use as an escalation channel. Follow the instructions on the screen.

#### Creating a New AutoShare
To create a new AutoShare, click the **AutoShare** tab, and click **Create AutoShare** in the top right corner. The Create AutoShare window opens. Select the Environment from which you'd like to automatically share incidents and the escalation channel you'd like to use. To add escalation channels, see *Creating a New Escalation Channel*. Click **Next**. A window opens with options specific to the escalation channel you selected. Enter the relevant information and click **Create**. The new AutoShare rule is added to the list.
