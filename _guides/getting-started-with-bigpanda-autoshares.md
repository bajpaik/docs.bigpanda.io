#### Automatically Share Incidents via Escalation Channels with AutoShare

AutoShare rules route incidents to key team members when and how they're needed to assist the resolution process. Any incident in any BigPanda Environment can be automatically shared to any escalation channel such as ServiceNow, JIRA, HipChat, Slack, or Asana. First configure one or more escalation channels in the Integrations tab then configure AutoShare rules in the AutoShare tab.

#### Creating a New Escalation Channel
Go to the **Integrations** tab. Scroll down to the **Sharing & Ticket Management** section and select the system you want to use as an escalation channel. Follow the instructions on the screen.

#### Creating a New AutoShare
To create a new AutoShare, navigate to the **AutoShare** tab and click the **Create AutoShare** button at the top right corner. A popup window will open. From the **Choose Environment** dropdown, select the Environment from which you'd like to automatically share incidents. Next, select an escalation channel from the **Escalate via** dropdown and click **Next**. To add escalation channels, refer to the *Creating a New Escalation Channel* section above. The next form is specific to the escalation channel you selected. Fill in the relevant info and click **Create**. A new AutoShare rule will be added to the list.
