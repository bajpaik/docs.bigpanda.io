BigPanda is an incident management platform for Modern Ops teams. Organize, prioritize and triage your incidents faster and more intelligently than ever before. Vastly improve your team's collaboration around Ops alerts and events. **The following guide is the first in our series** on getting started with BigPanda's incident feed. This product introduction will help you to get up and running quickly so you can get back to fixing the world's broken stuff.

The most important section of the BigPanda interface is the incident feed. The incident feed is always just a click away. Just click **OpsBox** in the menu at the top. Here you can track and manage all of your active incidents – no matter what system they're coming from: Nagios, New Relic, Pingdom, Zabbix, CloudWatch, Zenoss, and more than a dozen more – and the list is growing rapidly.

### Automatic Incident Clustering

The world's bugtrackers, ticket management systems, and issue-tracking tools weren't designed for Ops. Most of them were built a decade ago around the fundamental concept that every single ticket would be manually created by a reporting user. But that's not how it works for Modern Ops teams. The alerts that they manage are generated automatically by the tripping of thresholds in their monitoring stack and those alerts come in by the hundreds or even by the thousands. BigPanda digests that stream of alerts and intelligently clusters them into incidents by host, cluster, or application automatically.

### in Real-time
And BigPanda keeps you up-to-date in real time. Like you, more than once or twice, we've learned the harsh lesson that system-failure storms can brew in an instant. So we made sure that incidents in BigPanda are constantly consolidated and updated in real time. Every system and application status-change, from every monitoring service in your stack, propagates to your incident feed – all in an instant.

The success of your company depends on how well your production environment is doing. With BigPanda, taking care of your production environment is both efficient and painless. Now that you know your way around the BigPanda incident feed, let's take a look at its practical application day-to-day as we discuss incident prioritization and triage in [**part 2 of our Getting Started with BigPanda guide**](getting-started-with-bigpanda-incident-triage.html).
