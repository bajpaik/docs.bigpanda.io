After you've configured your integrations, you can start using BigPanda to manage your incidents.

The most important section of the BigPanda interface is the incident feed. Just click **Incidents** in the top menu. You can track and manage all of your active incidents from any of your integrated monitoring tools, including Nagios, New Relic, Pingdom, Zabbix, CloudWatch, Zenoss, and many more.

#### Automatic Incident Clustering

The world's bugtrackers, ticket management systems, and issue-tracking tools weren't designed for Ops. Most of them were built a decade ago around the fundamental concept that every single ticket would be manually created by a reporting user. But that's not how it works for modern Ops teams. The alerts that they manage are generated automatically by the tripping of thresholds in their monitoring stack and those alerts come in by the hundreds or even by the thousands. BigPanda digests that stream of alerts and intelligently clusters them into incidents by host, cluster, or application automatically.

#### In Real Time
And BigPanda keeps you up-to-date in real time. Like you, more than once or twice, we've learned the harsh lesson that system-failure storms can brew in an instant. So we made sure that incidents in BigPanda are constantly consolidated and updated in real time. Every system and application status-change, from every monitoring service in your stack, propagates to your incident feed â€“ all in an instant.

The success of your company depends on how well your production environment is doing. With BigPanda, taking care of your production environment is both efficient and painless. Now that you know your way around the BigPanda incident feed, let's take a look at its practical application day-to-day as we discuss incident organization, prioritization and triage in the next parts of the Getting Started guide.
