BigPanda is an incident management platform for modern Ops environments. With BigPanda, you will prioritize and route your incidents better and faster, while vastly improving your team's collaboration and processes. **This is part 2 in a series** on Getting Started with BigPanda. This guide will help you get up and running quickly and maximize the value you get out of the platform.

As we discussed in [part 1 of this series](getting-started-with-bigpanda-incident-feed), BigPanda automatically tackles the grouping of alerts into incidents by host, cluster, or application as they come in. Once that's done, the most important thing to do next is to decide on that incident's priority. This process is known as incident triage and it ensures that your team is channeling its efforts wisely. BigPanda gives you two easy-to-use ways to prioritize your work: snoozing and starring.
