##Incident Assignment##

As the proverb goes, two captains will sink the ship. Promote accountability and make sure incidents are resolved on time by assigning a single owner to every active incident. BigPanda makes it easy to assign incidents. Click on the assign icon (it looks like a person with a + next to his head). Then select a member of your team from the list.
