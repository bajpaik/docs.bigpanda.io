###BigPanda's incident log just got even better

Relying on email to manage your alerts can quickly get out of hand. But now, with BigPanda there's a better way. BigPanda gives you detailed information on all the actions which were performed on an incident and when they happened. Easily see all previous assignees and when the incident was snoozed or starred.

###And the New Integrations Keep Coming…

Every day, we get requests for more alert and deployment integrations and the BigPanda team is working to delivering them faster than you can say 404. Just in the last few weeks, we’ve added Sensu, PRTG, Opsview, Icinga, & AppDynamics.  This makes BigPanda the best way to see of your alerts in the context of other alerts from all your monitoring systems.
