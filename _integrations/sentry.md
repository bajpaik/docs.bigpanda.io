#### Define the Sentry Webhook  

For each project in Sentry:

* Go to `Settings > Manage Integrations`.
* Enable the `WebHooks` plugin (it might be already enabled). You should see a new item under the INTEGRATIONS section.  
* Click on `Save Changes`.
* Choose the new item called `WebHooks` and append the URL below to the `Callback URLs` text area:  
`$WEB_API_BASE_URL/data/integrations/sentry?$URL_PARAMS`
* Click on `Save Changes`

*Note: If you changed the default Rules in Sentry, please consult the relevant FAQ item called __What Rules do I need to configure?__.*
