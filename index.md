# Getting Started with BigPanda

BigPanda is an incident response platform that uses powerful data algorithms to help you manage Ops issues better & faster. 

We consolidate your endless stream of alerts into high level incidents, based on host, cluster or applications – so you can see critical incidents without filtering through noise. We visualizerelated alerts and code deploys side by side – so you can get quick insight on critical events. We make collaboration easy because we’ve simplified the conversation to only the data and exactly the insights that Ops teams need.

Always in real time. Without the noise and overhead. 
####That's BigPanda.

Welcome to Docs. We've compiled a few things that you might find handy. 

* If you're new to the BigPanda platform you might want to try the Getting Started Series in BigPanda university.  
* If you're looking to take your instance to the next level with more integrations, peruse the Integration Guides section. 
* Or if you're trying to zero in on a specific question, just try the search box at the left.
