### Q: 
I've Integrated with another system, but my integration still says "Pending".


### A:  
Don't worry, you most likely integrated BigPanda with your system correctly. The status will remain as "Pending" until after we receive the first alert from your external account. Once those alerts start rolling in, the status will shift to "installed".  

Think something has gone awry?
